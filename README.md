CRUD App with TypeScript and Redux 09 May 2021

To scaffold:  
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript   
npm i -S redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension  
npm i -D @types/redux @types/react-redux @types/redux-thunk  

delete the node_modules folder and npm i *again* to reinstall  

Update: incomplete because I was temporarily defeated.  I need to do some reserach and find out why it wasn't working.
